Hello there,

Trilingual Network Designer and Salesforce Developer. I am passionate about technologies and have more than 8 years of IT experience, mainly in basic programming and networking. I helped classmates and students with homework related to CCNA, programming both in Apex, Bash, Java and Python mainly. A team leader always works with co-workers with a good attitude to complete projects and goals together.

During the last couple of months, I helped out students from Costa Rican colleagues to implement networks, mainly for college projects. In addition to that, I gave them private lessons to pass the CCNA module exams. #CCNA #network #success #career #NetworkDesigner
