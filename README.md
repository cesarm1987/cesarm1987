Hello there,

Triligual Network Designer and Salesforce Developer. I am passionate about technologies with 8+ years of IT experience mainly in basic programing and networking. I helped classmates and students with homework related to CCNA, programing both in Java and Python mainly.

During the last couple of months I helped out students from Costa Rica Collegues to implement networks mainly for colleges projects.
In addition to that I gave them private lessons to pass the CCNA modules exams. #CCNA #network #success #career #NetworkDesigner
